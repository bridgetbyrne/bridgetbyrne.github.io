        <p> This university's tradition of football tailgating sustains the Department of Transportation Services' game day operational costs, generating $368,255 from 13,550 parking permits sold last semester. </p>
        <p> A core component of the college football fan experience is tailgating, and that requires a parking permit. Thousands of people come to campus, park their cars in campus parking lots, and set up a miniature party directly outside their car. Fans take it to extremes, hanging flags, setting up tents, playing lawn games, and enjoying elaborate cooking setups. The collective effect transforms the university’s parking lots into festivals.</p>
        <p> “Having everyone bring their friends and their friends, I just love having a spot where I can meet everyone,” Jackson Scheidhauer, a senior neurobiology and physiology major, said.</p>
        <p> Scheidhauer’s family started hosting tailgates when his older brother was a freshman at this university in 2019. They pay to park in Lot One and then move to a grassy area nearby, arriving as early as 6 a.m. to claim their preferred spot. </p>
        <p> Guests purchase game day parking permits ahead of the game for $20-$35 and permit holders can tailgate as long as they follow the rules in the tailgating guide. The lot where Scheidhauer’s family parks, Lot 1, netted $12,375 in parking permit sales last season.</p>

        <p> The grassy areas near parking lots are first come, first serve, which can be competitive. Schniderhour says another group once called the police when his family set up in an area that the group considered theirs. </p>
        <p> To make spaces for the thousands of people who come to campus, students who pay to park their cars in campus parking lots are required to move their cars to secondary lots. This has a chaotic effect on campus traffic. When games fall on Fridays, campus professors sometimes move their classes online or cancel them entirely. In 2019, the University canceled classes entirely for the Pennsylvania State game. </p>
        <p> Trevor Norton, a graduate student studying international relations, has been moving his car for game days for the past two football seasons. Last season, he had trouble finding parking in the designated top he was supposed to move to. </p>
        <p> “I really don’t know how they expect us all to fit in those two garages,” Norton said. </p>
        <img src="LotProfits.jpg" alt="Lot Profits">
        <p> Students who fail to move their car receive a $100 citation. The profit from those citations and from the parking permits guests purchase are vital to sustaining the tailgating phenomenon.</p>
        <p> Most of the money from game-day parking permits goes towards supporting tailgating, setting up mobile toilets, paying for additional campus security, and cleaning up at the end of the day. Game days are the busy days of the year for UMPD officers and the Emergency Dispatch Center. For most games, the entire department, over 100 people, are working. </p>
        <p> Any remaining profits split between the Department of Transportation Services and the Athletics department, according to a statement from the University. For most games, there is no remainder, according to David Allen, DOTS director. </p>
        <p> Dawn Nozeika, who graduated from this university in 1993 with a degree in fashion marketing, brings her family to at least one game a season. </p>
        <p> “Once we get to the school, I think they usually have enough staffing and signage and directions that I usually am able to find my lot fairly easily,” Nozeika said. </p>
