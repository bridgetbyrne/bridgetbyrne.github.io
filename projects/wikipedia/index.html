<h1>Grigori Rasputin</h1>

    <p class="graph">Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin (/ræˈspjuːtɪn/; Russian: Григорий Ефимович Распутин [ɡrʲɪˈɡorʲɪj jɪˈfʲiməvʲɪtɕ rɐˈsputʲɪn]; 
        21 January [O.S. 9 January] 1869 – 30 December [O.S. 17 December] 1916) was a Russian mystic and holy man. 
        He is best known for having befriended the imperial family of Nicholas II, the last Emperor of Russia, 
        through whom he gained considerable influence in the final years of the Russian Empire. </p>

    <p class="graph">Rasputin was born to a family of peasants in the Siberian village of Pokrovskoye, 
        located within Tyumensky Uyezd in Tobolsk Governorate (present-day Yarkovsky District in Tyumen Oblast). 
        He had a religious conversion experience after embarking on a pilgrimage to a monastery in 1897 and has been described as 
        a monk or as a strannik (wanderer or pilgrim), though he held no official position in the Russian Orthodox Church. 
        In 1903 or in the winter of 1904–1905, he travelled to Saint Petersburg and captivated a number of religious and social leaders, 
        eventually becoming a prominent figure in Russian society. In November 1905, Rasputin met Nicholas II and his empress consort, Alexandra Feodorovna. </p>

    <p class="graph"> In late 1906, Rasputin began acting as a faith healer for Nicholas' and Alexandra's only son, Alexei Nikolaevich,
        who suffered from haemophilia. He was a divisive figure at court, seen by some Russians as a mystic, visionary and prophet, 
        and by others as a religious charlatan. The extent of Rasputin's power reached an all-time high in 1915, when Nicholas left 
        Saint Petersburg to oversee the Imperial Russian Army as it was engaged in the First World War. In his absence, Rasputin and Alexandra 
        consolidated their influence across the Russian Empire. However, as Russian military defeats mounted on the Eastern Front, both figures became 
        increasingly unpopular, and in the early morning of 30 December [O.S. 17 December] 1916, Rasputin was assassinated by a group of conservative 
        Russian noblemen who opposed his influence over the imperial family. </p>

    <p class="graph">Historians often suggest that Rasputin's scandalous and sinister reputation helped discredit the Tsarist government, thus 
        precipitating the overthrow of the House of Romanov shortly after his assassination. Accounts of his life and influence were 
        often based on hearsay and rumor; he remains a mysterious and captivating figure in popular culture.[1] </p>

<h2>Failed assassination attempt</h2>
<p class="graph">On 12 July [O.S. 29 June] 1914, a 33-year-old peasant woman named Chionya Guseva attempted to assassinate Rasputin by stabbing him in the stomach outside his home in Pokrovskoye.[77] Rasputin was seriously wounded, and for a time it was not clear if he would survive.[78] After surgery[79] and some time in a hospital in Tyumen,[80] he recovered. </p>

<p class="graph">Guseva was a follower of Iliodor, a former priest who had supported Rasputin before denouncing his sexual escapades and self-aggrandizement in December 1911.[81][82] A radical conservative and anti-semite, Iliodor had been part of a group of establishment figures who had attempted to drive a wedge between Rasputin and the imperial family in 1911. When this effort failed, Iliodor was banished from Saint Petersburg and was ultimately defrocked.[81][83] Guseva claimed to have acted alone, having read about Rasputin in the newspapers and believing him to be a "false prophet and even an Antichrist".[84] Both the police and Rasputin, however, believed that Iliodor had instigated the assassination attempt.[81] Iliodor fled the country before he could be questioned, and Guseva was found to be not responsible for her actions by reason of insanity.[81] </p>

<h2>Assassination</h2>

<p class="graph">A group of nobles led by Purishkevich, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich and Prince Felix Yusupov decided that Rasputin's influence over Alexandra threatened the Russian Empire. They concocted a plan in December 1916 to kill Rasputin, apparently by luring him to the Yusupovs' Moika Palace. </p>

<p class="graph">Rasputin was murdered during the early morning on 30 December [O.S. 17 December] 1916 at the home of Prince Yusupov. He died of three gunshot wounds, one of which was a close-range shot to his forehead. Little is certain about his death beyond this, and the circumstances of his death have been the subject of considerable speculation. According to Smith, "what really happened at the Yusupov home on 17 December will never be known".[87] The story that Yusupov recounted in his memoirs, however, has become the most frequently told version of events.[88] </p>

<p class="graph">According to Yusupov's account, Rasputin was invited to his palace shortly after midnight and ushered into the basement. Yusupov offered tea and cakes which had been laced with cyanide. After initially refusing the cakes, Rasputin began to eat them and, to Yusupov's surprise, appeared unaffected by the poison.[89] Rasputin then asked for some Madeira wine (which had also been poisoned) and drank three glasses, but still showed no sign of distress.[n 1] At around 2:30 am, Yusupov excused himself to go upstairs, where his fellow conspirators were waiting. He took a revolver from Pavlovich, then returned to the basement and told Rasputin that he'd "better look at the crucifix and say a prayer", referring to a crucifix in the room, then shot him once in the chest. The conspirators then drove to Rasputin's apartment, with Sukhotin wearing Rasputin's coat and hat in an attempt to make it look as though Rasputin had returned home that night.[90] Upon returning to his palace, Yusupov went back to the basement to ensure that Rasputin was dead.[91] Suddenly, Rasputin leaped up and attacked Yusupov, who freed himself with some effort and fled upstairs. Rasputin followed Yusupov into the palace's courtyard, where he was shot by Purishkevich. He collapsed into a snowbank. The conspirators then wrapped his body in cloth, drove it to the Petrovsky Bridge and dropped it into the Little Nevka river.[92] </p>

<p class="graph">In an unsubstantiated claim, Grand Duchess Tatiana, who was earlier alleged to have been raped by Rasputin, was present at the site of Rasputin's murder, "disguised as a lieutenant of the Chevaliers-Gardes, so that she could revenge herself on Rasputin who had tried to violate her". Maurice Paléologue, the French ambassador to Russia, wrote that Tatiana had supposedly witnessed Rasputin's castration, but he doubted the credibility of the rumor.[93] </p>

<p class="graph">In a modern analysis of Rasputin's death, published on the 100th anniversary of the event, Dr Carolyn Harris of the University of Toronto notes that the actual circumstances were apparently less dramatic than Yusupov's account. Rasputin's daughter recorded that her father disliked sweet food and would not have eaten the supposedly poisoned cakes. An autopsy account by the official surgeon involved has no record of poisoning or drowning but simply records death by a single bullet fired into the head at close range.[94] </p>
